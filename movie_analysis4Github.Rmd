# Are movies getting better?
## Introduction
Do you miss the good old days? Nostalgia really has a way of messing with our perception of whether things are improving. Clearly in technological terms we are better off, but what about culturally? To question whether art is getting better or worse is completely subjective, but what if we could ask everyone what they think on pieces of art throughout time and rate it, that way we could quantify whether there is improvement or not. Thanks to the Internet Movie Database (IMDb) we can.

Using Data acquired on the 16th July 2018 publically available from IMDb, we will report our findings.
## Tools used 
```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggrepel) 
library(gghighlight)
library(ggridges)
library(tidytext)
library(readr)
library(scales)
library(knitr)
```



```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```



## Ratings
Perhaps before we search through trends throughout time, it is better to establish a baseline. The average movie rating fits this purpose and naturally falls a good entry point to this report.

We introduce our first dataset, df_ratings. That is the ratings data frame. This is our simplest dataset and provides us the Movie ID thatâ€™ll act as a Foreign key between our various datasets, the average rating for a movie (averageRating) and the number of votes for each movie (numVotes).

We provide the first few entries to show this dataset clearly.
```{r echo=FALSE, error=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
read_imdb = function(data_path) {
  path = "C:/Users/julia/Documents/Data Science/Movie-Analysis/"
  read_tsv(paste0(path, data_path), na = "\\N", progress=F)
}
df_ratings = read_imdb("data.tsv")
df_ratings %>% head()
```
We begin by plotting the average rating of all movies.
```{r echo=FALSE, error=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
plot <- ggplot(df_ratings, aes(x = numVotes, y = averageRating)) +
          geom_bin2d() +
          scale_x_log10(labels = comma) +
          scale_y_continuous(breaks = 1:10) +
          scale_fill_viridis_c(labels = comma,option = "E") +
          labs(x="Number of Votes", y="Average Rating", title="Average IMBd rating and how many people vote that way")

ggsave("imdb-1.png", plot, width=4, height=3)
plot(plot)
```
![](imdb-1.png)

## Expanding our dataset 
```{r echo=FALSE, error=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
df_basics = read_imdb("title.basics.tsv")
```
Now this extensive dataset is added, we'll combine them
```{r echo=FALSE, error=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
df_ratings <- df_ratings %>% left_join(df_basics)
head(df_ratings)
```
Now with our new extensive data frame we move to perform the real analysis. 
```{r echo=FALSE, error=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
plot1 <- ggplot(df_ratings %>% filter(titleType == "movie", numVotes >= 10), aes(x = startYear, y = averageRating)) +
          geom_bin2d() +
          geom_smooth(color="black") +
          scale_x_continuous() +
          scale_y_continuous(breaks = 1:10) +
          scale_fill_viridis_c(option = "plasma", labels = comma, trans = 'log10') +
          labs(title="Average movie ratings for all genres")
plot(plot1)
ggsave("imdb-2.png", plot1, width=4, height=3)
```



Making a subset was the first challenge, this is as follos 
```{r eval=FALSE}
df_ratingsHORROR = subset(df_ratings, grepl("Horror", genres))
```

```{r echo=FALSE, error=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
plot2 <- ggplot(df_ratingsHORROR %>% filter(titleType == "movie", numVotes >= 10), aes(x = startYear, y = averageRating)) +
          geom_bin2d() +
          geom_smooth(color="black") +
          scale_x_continuous() +
          scale_y_continuous(breaks = 1:10) +
          scale_fill_viridis_c(option = "plasma", labels = comma, trans = 'log10') + 
          labs(title="Horror movie ratings throughout time")
ggsave("imdb-3.png", plot2, width=4, height=3)
plot(plot2)

```
As previously done for Horror we will now recreate for Comedy
```{r eval=FALSE}
df_ratingsCOMEDY = subset(df_ratings, grepl("Comedy", genres))
```
might be error here pls no
```{r echo=FALSE, error=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
plot3 <- ggplot(df_ratingsCOMEDY %>% filter(titleType == "movie", numVotes >= 10), aes(x = startYear, y = averageRating)) +
          geom_bin2d() +
          geom_smooth(color="black") +
          scale_x_continuous() +
          scale_y_continuous(breaks = 1:10) +
          scale_fill_viridis_c(option = "plasma", labels = comma, trans = 'log10') + 
          labs(title="Comedy movie ratings throughout time")
ggsave("imdb-4.png", plot3, width=4, height=3)
plot(plot3)

```
